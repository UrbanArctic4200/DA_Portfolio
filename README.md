# Data Analyst Portfolio
A portfolio of Power BI Data Analysis Projects where data from different sources in a company are analyzed and reports elaborating on the key findings, insights, correlations, technology solutions, and recommendations for existing IT infrastructure and Information security policies are constructed along with Power BI dashboards that analyze and track key performance indicators (KPIs).

All findings, insights, solutions, and recommendations can be found in respective attached reports.

Scenario:

The JustConnect! Company is in competition with a plethora of companies that provide the same products and
services. This company is setting a standard and shaking up the market with a personal touch and strong
customer service. To keep up with the consumer expectations and initiate new customers from different
areas, there is a need for expansion. For this expansion, the company needs to answer several business
questions. Findings and insights were reported directly to the CEO of the company.

1.) IT Help Desk Performance

The Company CEO is interested in examining how quickly issues are resolved, improving
customer satisfaction. Here, I 

-Analyzed the help desk tickets, including number of tickets, number of high-
priority tickets, and average response time. 

-Understood what causes high-priority tickets, and improved resolution times with better understanding of ticket details.

2.) Employee Attrition

The Company CEO is curious to find the factors that lead to employee attrition. This will be very
important to discuss as the CEO moves forward with the expansion of the company. The stakeholders
are interested in this analysis, which will provide some insights to the leadership effectiveness. The
analysis takes some key point indicators (distance, education, job role, and income) and
provides an analysis.

3.) Retail Sales and Marketing

In the expansion process, the Company CEO realizes that there will need to be a review of the
product-related information like cost, revenue, price, and so on across years and ordering method.
This will be especially important to the stakeholders as they will see what has worked and what has
not. For this data set, I  was an analyst for one of the stakeholders and was asked to find insights related to
sales and marketing/profit and cost.

her competitors. As a result, I was asked as an analyst to predict consumer behavior and ways to retain them. As a result, I...

-Analyzed all relevant customer data and developed focused customer retention programs.

needs help in determining the promotion campaign for the new products. As a Result, I...

-Quickly analyzed test market campaigns based on responses, revenue, and other key metrics. 

-Predicted who will respond to which campaign by which channel and why.
